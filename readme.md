This simple command line utility lets you batch-rename files from the comfort of your favourite text editor. You specify the files to be renamed as arguments, e.g.

    $ vimv *.mp3

The list of files will be opened in the editor specified by the `$EDITOR` environment variable, one filename per line. Edit the list, save, and exit. The files will be renamed to the edited filenames.

Vimv is written in Rust â€” if you have a Rust compiler available you can install it directly from the package index using `cargo`:

    $ cargo install vimv
